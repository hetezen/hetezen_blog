### Numbing | 自我麻痹

> The most powerful emotions that we experience have very sharp points, like the tip of a thorn. When they prick us, they cause discomfort and even pain. Just the anticipation or fear of these feelings can trigger intolerable vulnerability in us. We know it’s coming. For many of us, our first response to vulnerability and pain of these sharp points is not to lean into the discomfort and feel our way through but rather to make it go away. We do that by numbing and taking the edge off the pain with whatever provides the quickest relief. We can anesthetize with a whole bunch of stuff, including alcohol, drugs, food, sex, relationships, money, work, caretaking, gambling, staying busy, affairs, chaos, shopping, planning, perfectionism, constant change, and the Internet.

我们所经历的最强烈的情绪就像尖锐的刺，当它们刺伤我们时，会引起不适甚至疼痛。仅仅是对这些情感的期待或恐惧，就会触发我们难以忍受的脆弱。当这样的情绪即将到来时，很多人对这种脆弱和尖锐刺痛的第一反应不是直面和感受，而是躲避，试图让它消失，用任何能快速缓解疼痛的方法来麻痹自己。有很多东西可以用来自我麻痹，包括酒精、毒品、食物、性、恋爱、金钱、工作、照料他人、赌博、忙碌、出轨、陷入混乱、购物、做计划、完美主义、不停改变和互联网。
