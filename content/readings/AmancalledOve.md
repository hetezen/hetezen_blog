### To love someone is like moving into a house

> To love someone is like moving into a house, Sonja used to say. At first you fall in love in everything new, you wonder every morning that this is one's own, as if they are afraid that someone will suddenly come tumbling through the door and say that there has been a serious mistake and that it simply was not meant to would live so fine. But as the years go by, the facade worn, the wood cracks here and there, and you start to love this house not so much for all the ways it is perfect in that for all the ways it is not. You become familiar with all its nooks and crannies. How to avoid that the key gets stuck in the lock if it is cold outside. Which floorboards have some give when you step on them, and exactly how to open the doors for them not to creak. That's it, all the little secrets that make it your home.

爱上一个人就像搬进一座房子，一开始你会爱上新的一切，陶醉于拥有它的每一个清晨，就好像害怕会有人突然冲进房门指出这是个错误，你根本不该住得这么好。但是经年累月后，房子的外墙开始陈旧，木板七翘八裂，你会因为它本该完美的不完美而渐渐不再那么爱它。然后你渐渐谙熟它所有的破绽和瑕疵。天冷的时候如何避免钥匙卡在锁孔里；哪块地板踩上去的时候容易弯曲；怎么打开一扇橱门又不让它嘎吱作响。这些都是会赋予你归属感的小秘密。

### Death is a strange thing

> Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.

死亡是一桩奇怪的事情。人们终其一生都在假装它并不存在，尽管这是生命的最大动机之一。我们其中一些人有足够时间认识死亡，他们得以活得更努力、更执着、更壮烈。有些人却要等到它真正逼近时才意识到它的反义词有多美好。另一些人深受其困扰，在它宣布到来之前就早早地坐进等候室。我们害怕它，但我们更害怕它发生在身边的人身上。对死亡最大的恐惧，在于它与我们擦肩而过，留下我们独自一人。
