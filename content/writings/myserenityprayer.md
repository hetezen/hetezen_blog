> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  
Courage to change the things I can,  
And wisdom to know the difference.  

Give me coffee to change the things I can,  
Alcohol to accept those that I cannot,  
And I mix them together if I don't know the difference.

── Dedicated to one of my favourite drinks, Irish coffee
