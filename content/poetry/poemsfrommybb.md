If my bb was a baby  
She would be so lovely maybe

----

If my kitten was a lady  
She would eat food slow and steady

---

Every train that passes nightly  
Can't replace you smiling brightly

Every train that passes nightly  
Can't disturb us sleeping tightly

Every train that passes nightly  
Can't carry away you smiling brightly


---

If my bb was a kitten  
I would be so often bitten
